# FBMovies AKA "Movie-me"

While working on another React-Native app, I had a look at a tutorial provided by FaceBook. It's a simple list-view of movies in cinemas right now, as given by Rotten Tomatoes, with each row representing a movie.

This is a toy application is designed to teach the user to become familiar with mobile UI widgets and asynchronous data fetching - but I feel it's **so close** to actually being genuinely useful.

Introducing _Movie-Me_ - an app that simply decides for you, what movie you should go see in the cinema.

No more research, no more dithering, no more debating among friendship groups, just let the app decide.

#### Great! I despise the paralysis of choice and the squabbling of others. How will it work?

You launch the app, it picks the highest rated movie currently in cinemas, and you go see it. 

Seen it already? No worries, swipe left and pick the next one down the list, Tinder-style.


To make this into a quality app that focuses on doing one thing great, it needs to 

+ Have an exceptionally clean and focused interface
+ Provide informative and flattering UI widgets to push current top-of-the-pile film

As an extension of the core concept it should

+ Only present films showing in your local area
+ Provide times and routing to your film destination
